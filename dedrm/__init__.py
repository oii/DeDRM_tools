# All credit given to iâ™¥cabbages and The Dark Reverser for the original standalone scripts.
# We had the much easier job of converting them to a calibre plugin.
#
# This plugin is meant to decrypt eReader PDBs, Adobe Adept ePubs, Barnes & Noble ePubs,
# Adobe Adept PDFs, Amazon Kindle and Mobipocket files without having to
# install any dependencies... other than having calibre installed, of course.
#
# Configuration:
# Check out the plugin's configuration settings by clicking the "Customize plugin"
# button when you have the "DeDRM" plugin highlighted (under Preferences->
# Plugins->File type plugins). Once you have the configuration dialog open, you'll
# see a Help link on the top right-hand side.
